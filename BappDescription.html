<p>PacketPurifier is a Burp Suite extension designed to identify influential elements of a packet (parameters, cookies, headers) that influence server responses. The extension sends each request multiple times to establish a baseline. It then removes each element one by one, observing changes in the response compared to the baseline. Analysis results are displayed in the Results panel, and a streamlined request with only influential elements is sent to Repeater.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Element Filtering:</strong> PacketPurifier includes an option to select specific elements (Parameters, Cookies, Headers) for analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable Number of Baselines:</strong> The number of baselines used for comparison can be adjusted between 2 to 10 to increase the analysis accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Various Baseline Establishment Criteria:</strong> The extension identifies values that change with every request (like timestamps, CSRF tokens) and removes them while establishing the baseline. Two normalization methods are provided:</li>
  <ul>
  <li><code class=InlineCode>Basic (default)</code>: This mode removes entire lines in the response that show changes during the baselines establishment.</li>
  <li><code class=InlineCode>Accurate</code>: This mode precisely identifies and removes only the variable parts of a response when establishing the baseline. This methods performance improves with an increase in the number of baseline requests.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To use PacketPurifier, send the request packet you wish to analyze to the extension via the context menu, then start Analyze Request. The analysis results can be checked in the Results and Details panels.</p>

<p>Please note that elements that do not have an impact or are not reflected in the response cannot be identified. This could potentially limit its effectiveness when testing for blind vulnerabilities.</p>
