<p>
  Packet Purifier identifies which request elements (parameters, cookies, and headers) influence server responses. By
  sending multiple baseline requests to establish expected behavior, it systematically removes each element and compares
  the resulting response against the baseline to determine which elements are influential.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Automatically sends a minimized request containing only influential elements to Repeater</li>
  <li>Selectively analyze specific element types (parameters, cookies, headers) or all elements together</li>
  <li>Configure the number of baseline requests (2-10) to improve detection accuracy</li>
  <li>Choose between Basic normalization (removes entire dynamic response lines) or Accurate normalization (removes only
    variable portions of lines) when establishing baselines</li>
  <li>View detailed request and response data for each identified influential element</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on any request in Burp and select "Send to Packet Purifier" from the context menu</li>
  <li>In the Packet Purifier tab, configure the analysis settings (element types to test, normalization method, and
    number of baseline requests)</li>
  <li>Click "Analyze Request" to begin the analysis</li>
  <li>Review the results table to see which elements caused response changes when removed</li>
  <li>Check the minimized request in Repeater containing only the influential elements</li>
</ol>
